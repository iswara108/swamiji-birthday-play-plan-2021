          A guided tour of the palace and the new hall by Śakuni. He gives some
          instructions about do's and don'ts in the tour, then proceeds to tell
          about the new hall and the Kauravas heritage. <br />
          After the tour, Śakuni tactfully invites Yudhiṣṭhira to a game of
          dice, just to "nicely pass the time". <br />
          The brothers are nervous and Yudhiṣṭhira tries to escape the game, but
          ultimately accepts the challenge. <br />Śakuni shows the good dice,
          and hides the faulty one. <br />
          Śakuni invites Yudhiṣṭhira to put something on the stakes. Yudhiṣṭhira
          starts with something small (exclaiming the stakes and puts some chips
          on the table), and Śakuni matches the stakes, and throws the dice.
          "Won" he proclaims, and gathers the chips to his pile. <br />This
          process gets repeated until Yudhiṣṭhira loses his brothers, himself
          and their wife. <br />
          Duśāsana is sent to tell Draupadī that she is now the slave of the
          Kauravas.
