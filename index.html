          shortly explain the background, where and who they are. <br />
          At the end, the priest frantically knocks on the door and complains
          that Kāśī stole his sticks for fire. The Pāṇḍavas hastily go after her

        <h3>Scene 4: The game of dice</h3>
        <p class="duration">Duration: 5 minutes</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Special setup</strong>: Śakuni has a loud speaker and the
          Pāṇḍavas have their cameras ready - for a guided tour
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          A guided tour of the palace and the new hall by Śakuni. He gives some
          instructions about do's and don'ts in the tour, then proceeds to tell
          about the new hall and the Kauravas heritage. <br />
          After the tour, Śakuni tactfully invites Yudhiṣṭhira to a game of
          dice, just to "nicely pass the time". <br />
          The brothers are nervous and Yudhiṣṭhira tries to escape the game, but
          ultimately accepts the challenge. <br />Śakuni shows the good dice,
          and hides the faulty one. <br />
          Śakuni invites Yudhiṣṭhira to put something on the stakes. Yudhiṣṭhira
          starts with something small (exclaiming the stakes and puts some chips
          on the table), and Śakuni matches the stakes, and throws the dice.
          "Won" he proclaims, and gathers the chips to his pile. <br />This
          process gets repeated until Yudhiṣṭhira loses his brothers, himself
          and their wife. <br />
          Duśāsana is sent to tell Draupadī that she is now the slave of the
          Kauravas.

          Duśāsana approaches Draupadī and tells her she is a slave now of the
          Kauravas. Yudhiṣṭhira has lost her in a game of dice. Now she is to do
          everything he says, as a slave. <br />Draupadī laughs and says she
          cannot be a slave.

          Bhīma asks Yudhiṣṭhira what they should do, Śakuni intervenes and
          suggests one final tossing of the dice. If the Pāṇḍavas win - they get
          everything back. If they lose - they are exiled for 12 years into the
          forest and a 13th year in incognito. If they are discovered - another
          period of 12 years in exile. <br />The game is on. They lose. <br />
          Everything quiets down and becomes still. The music

          quietly leave. Curtain closes. Music gradually quiets as the curtain
          slowly closes.
